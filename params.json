Works great! Give it a try.\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\nTo initialize the plugin simply call:\r\n <pre>\r\n \r\n    \r\n // Put this inside the jQuery document ready statement\r\n    $('#container').fbresponsivecomments({\r\n        appId:'your_appId_here',\r\n        url: 'your_domain_here' \r\n    });\r\n    \r\n // Put this in the body where you want the comments to show up\r\n&lt;div id=\"container\">\r\n     &lt;div class=\"fb-comments\" data-href=\"YOUR PAGE URL HERE\" data-num-posts=\"2\" mobile=\"false\">&lt;/div>\r\n&lt;/div>\r\n\r\n</pre>\r\n### Options\r\n* 'appId': 'your_appId_here',              \r\n* 'url': 'your_url_here',               \r\n* 'posts' : '5'                           \r\n\r\n1. **appId** _**required**_ : the appId Facebook gives you when you create an app found at [Facebook Apps](http://developers.facebook.com/apps)\r\n2. **url** _**required**_ : the domain it will reside on. Ex. http://www.example.com \r\n3. **posts** _**optional**_  : _default: 5_  - the amount of posts to show initially. If there are more comments than the default it will produce a button that reads \"load more posts\"","tagline":"Responsive comments for facebook that spans mobile, tablet and desktop"}
